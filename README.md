# Security_System_ARM_Processor
A system which uses multi-level security systems for the protection of vital information.

In this system a user has to pass a variety of authorization levels to be able to retrieve the confidential data stored .The first level of authentication will be a keypad password entry where the user is asked to enter a password through a keypad. In the next level the user is asked to enter a combination using the Dip switches. Finally the user is asked to solve a Rubik pattern with a pre defined no of swipes. Also this system has a provision of lock-down when the unauthorized access codes are input to the system.
